At a Glance: 

This project analyses food delivery data to uncover market trends, service distribution, and possible operational inefficiencies. Key outputs include SQL queries and visualisations.

## 1. Project Overview  ##

This project explores food delivery platform data to identify market trends and inneficiencies, customer value drivers, and geographic opportunities. 

The analysis focuses on pricing, ratings, restaurant distribution, payment methods, and menu availability to support data-driven decision-making for restaurant partners and platform stakeholders.

## 2. Objectives ##

The primary objectives of this project are to:

- Understand the structure and relationships within a  food delivery database;
- Analyze pricing, ratings, restaurant distribution across locations, and other customer value indicators;
- Translate analytical findings into clear, business-oriented insights;


## 3. Deliverables ##

- SQL queries answering predefined and exploratory business questions;
- Visualisations supporting each key insight;


## 4. Key Business Questions ##

Core questions:
- What is the price distribution of menu items?
- How are restaurants geographically distributed?
- Which are the top 10 pizza restaurants by rating?
- Where are kapsalons (or selected dishes) offered, and at what average price?

Exploratory questions:
- Which restaurants offer the best price-to-rating ratio?
- Where are delivery “dead zones” with limited restaurant coverage?
- How does vegetarian and vegan availability vary by area?
- Who are the top hummus-serving restaurants?

Additional questions derived during exploration:

- Where are the top rated vegetarian restaurants?
- Where bancontact card is not a payment option? 

## 5. Key Insights ##

**Pricing inefficiencies or outliers:**

Menu item prices are strongly concentrated below €15, with a secondary cluster around €20–30. Higher-priced items are rare, suggesting a market centered on affordability rather than premium positioning, with limited price dispersion at the top end.

**High-value restaurants relative to ratings:**

Restaurants offering fritters consistently dominate the top rankings for price-to-rating ratio, indicating strong perceived value driven by low pricing combined with high customer satisfaction.

**Geographic supply gaps:**

Restaurants offering fritters consistently dominate the top rankings for price-to-rating ratio, indicating strong perceived value driven by low pricing combined with high customer satisfaction.

**Dietary preference coverage patterns:**

Restaurant coverage is uneven across locations, with 78 postal-code areas showing minimal availability. These gaps are concentrated primarily in the 8000–9000 postal code range, highlighting potential expansion opportunities for the platform.

**Other:**

Overall, value-driven offerings dominate the platform, while premium pricing and specialized dietary options appear underrepresented, suggesting opportunities for differentiation through menu diversity and targeted geographic expansion.
